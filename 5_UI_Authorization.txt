Purpose:
In AppMusicRazor
Adjust UI to hide and show buttons depending on User Authorized to access the resource

Steps:
1. In ListOfGroups.cshtml and ViewGroup.cshtml make sure below using and injections are in place
    @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
    @using AppMusicRazor.ModelAuthorization;
    @inject IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;

2.  In ListOfGroups.cshtml make a call to AuthorizeAsync to check if User is Authorized to access the property in the Model
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "List groups";
    var authResult = await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(User, Model.MusicGroups.First(), csMusicGroupOperations.Delete);
}

3.  In ViewGroup.cshtml make a call to AuthorizeAsync to check if User is Authorized to access the property in the Model
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "View group";
    var authResult = await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(User, Model.MusicGroup, MusicGroupOperations.Delete);
}

4. In ListOfGroups.cshtml remove New, Edit and Delete buttons if User is not Authenticated to access resoure

    <div class="@(authResult.Succeeded?"col-md-10": "col-md-12") themed-grid-head-col">Group Name</div>
        @if (authResult.Succeeded)
        {...}

5. In ViewGroup.cshtml remove the Edit button if User is not Authenticated to access resoure
    @if (authResult.Succeeded)
    {...}


6. Run the app and see that the buttons for user actions for Delete, Edit and New is only visible when you are logged in
